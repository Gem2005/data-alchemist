## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   cd data-alchemist
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access the application**: Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser

3. **Upload data**: Use the "Data Upload" tab to upload CSV/XLSX files

4. **Manage data**: Edit and validate data in the "Data Management" tab

5. **Create rules**: Build business rules in the "Rule Builder" tab

6. **Set priorities**: Configure weights in the "Prioritization" tab

7. **Use AI**: Query data and get suggestions in the "AI Assistant" tab

8. **Export results**: Download processed data and rules in the "Export" tab

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Working Features
